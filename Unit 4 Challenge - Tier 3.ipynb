Great job getting through those challenging DataCamp courses. You're learning a lot in a short span of time - so let's apply your knowledge in the real world. \n","\n","In this notebook, we're going to apply the skills you've been learning, bridging the gap between the controlled environment of DataCamp and the *slightly* messier work that data scientists do with actual datasets!\n","\n","Here’s the mystery we’re going to solve: ***which boroughs of London have seen the greatest increase in housing prices, on average, over the last two decades?***\n","\n","\n","A borough is just a fancy word for district. You may be familiar with the five boroughs of New York… [well, there are 32 boroughs within Greater London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_boroughs). Some of them are more desirable areas to live in, and the data will reflect that with a greater rise in housing prices.\n","\n","This is the Tier One notebook, which is the easiest tier. More of the code has been filled in already for you, so you have to less research on how to complete the lines. We ask that you only complete this tier if you've given Tiers Two and Three your best effort and been thwarted. We also ask, once you complete this tier, to go back to the highest difficulty level and give it another go. We really want you to internalize the skills you're learning.\n","\n","\n","This challenge will make use of only what you learned in the following DataCamp courses: \n","- Prework courses (Introduction to Python for Data Science, Intermediate Python for Data Science)\n","- Data Types for Data Science\n","- Python Data Science Toolbox (Part One) \n","- pandas Foundations\n","- Manipulating DataFrames with pandas\n","- Merging DataFrames with pandas\n","\n","Of the tools, techniques and concepts in the above DataCamp courses, this challenge should require the application of the following: \n","- **pandas**\n","    - **data ingestion and inspection** (pandas Foundations, Module One) \n","    - **exploratory data analysis** (pandas Foundations, Module Two)\n","    - **tidying and cleaning** (Manipulating DataFrames with pandas, Module Three) \n","    - **transforming DataFrames** (Manipulating DataFrames with pandas, Module One)\n","    - **subsetting DataFrames with lists** (Manipulating DataFrames with pandas, Module One) \n","    - **filtering DataFrames** (Manipulating DataFrames with pandas, Module One) \n","    - **grouping data** (Manipulating DataFrames with pandas, Module Four) \n","    - **melting data** (Manipulating DataFrames with pandas, Module Three) \n","    - **advanced indexing** (Manipulating DataFrames with pandas, Module Four) \n","- **matplotlib** (Intermediate Python for Data Science, Module One)\n","- **fundamental data types** (Data Types for Data Science, Module One) \n","- **dictionaries** (Intermediate Python for Data Science, Module Two)\n","- **handling dates and times** (Data Types for Data Science, Module Four)\n","- **function definition** (Python Data Science Toolbox - Part One, Module One)\n","- **default arguments, variable length, and scope** (Python Data Science Toolbox - Part One, Module Two) \n","- **lambda functions and error handling** (Python Data Science Toolbox - Part One, Module Four) "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"v6PO84SgoQux"},"source":["## The Data Science Pipeline\n","Data Science is magical.

 2.2. Cleaning the data (Part 1)\n","Data cleaning has a bad rep, but remember what your momma told you: cleanliness is next to godliness. Data cleaning can be really satisfying and fun. In the dark ages of programming, data cleaning was a tedious and difficult ordeal. Nowadays, new and improved tools have simplified the process. Getting good at data cleaning opens up a world of possibilities for data scientists and programmers. \n"," \n","The first operation you want to do on the dataset is called **transposition**. You *transpose* a table when you flip the columns into rows, and *vice versa*. \n","\n","If you transpose this DataFrame then the borough names will become the row indices, and the date time objects will become the column headers. Since your end goal is tidy data, where each row will represent a borough and each column will contain data about that borough at a certain point in time, transposing the table bring us closer to where you want to be.\n","\n","Python makes transposition simple.\n","\n","Each pandas DataFrame already has the *.T* attribute which is the transposed version of that DataFrame.\n","\n","Assign the transposed version of the original to a new variable. Let’s call it *properties_T*. \n","\n","Boom! You’ve got a transposed table to play with."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":132,"metadata":{"colab":{},"colab_type":"code","id":"28P8-GkeoQu_"},"outputs":[],"source":["props_T = props.T"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":133,"metadata":{"colab":{},"colab_type":"code","id":"7BcjtHOwoQvB"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <th>5</th>\n","      <th>6</th>\n","      <th>7</th>\n","      <th>8</th>\n","      <th>9</th>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <th>989</th>\n","      <th>990</th>\n","      <th>991</th>\n","      <th>992</th>\n","      <th>993</th>\n","      <th>994</th>\n","      <th>995</th>\n","      <th>996</th>\n","      <th>997</th>\n","      <th>998</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 0</th>\n","      <td>NaT</td>\n","      <td>1995-01-01 00:00:00</td>\n","      <td>1995-02-01 00:00:00</td>\n","      <td>1995-03-01 00:00:00</td>\n","      <td>1995-04-01 00:00:00</td>\n","      <td>1995-05-01 00:00:00</td>\n","      <td>1995-06-01 00:00:00</td>\n","      <td>1995-07-01 00:00:00</td>\n","      <td>1995-08-01 00:00:00</td>\n","      <td>1995-09-01 00:00:00</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>NaT</td>\n","      <td>NaT</td>\n","      <td>NaT</td>\n","      <td>NaT</td>\n","      <td>NaT</td>\n","      <td>NaT</td>\n","      <td>NaT</td>\n","      <td>NaT</td>\n","      <td>NaT</td>\n","      <td>NaT</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>City of London</th>\n","      <td>E09000001</td>\n","      <td>91448.98487</td>\n","      <td>82202.77314</td>\n","      <td>79120.70256</td>\n","      <td>77101.20804</td>\n","      <td>84409.14932</td>\n","      <td>94900.51244</td>\n","      <td>110128.0423</td>\n","      <td>112329.4376</td>\n","      <td>104473.1096</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>NaT</td>\n","      <td>NaT</td>\n","      <td>NaT</td>\n","      <td>NaT</td>\n","      <td>NaT</td>\n","      <td>NaT</td>\n","      <td>NaT</td>\n","      <td>NaT</td>\n","      <td>NaT</td>\n","      <td>NaT</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Barking &amp;
